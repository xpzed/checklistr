# CheckListr Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** July 30, 2025

Thanks for using CheckListr! By using our app, you're agreeing to these simple rules.

## What am I agreeing to?
By using CheckListr, you're agreeing that:
* You get to use the app for your personal use.
* You won't try to sell, copy, or reverse-engineer the app.
* You'll use the app responsibly and legally.

The app itself—its code, name, and design—is owned by us, **xpzed**.

## Who is responsible for the service working?
CheckListr depends on the Google Tasks service to function. If Google Tasks is down or changes its API, our app may stop working correctly. We can't be responsible for issues caused by Google's services.

## What happens if something goes wrong? (The "As-Is" Part)
Think of CheckListr as a helpful tool we're providing, but we can't promise it will be flawless. We provide the app "as-is," without any warranties.

This means that **we are not responsible for any problems that might happen from using the app**, such as data loss, bugs, or other issues. You use it at your own risk.

## How do I stop using the app?
Just uninstall it from your computer. That's it!

## Questions?
