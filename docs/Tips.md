# CheckListr Tips

## Use Keyboard Shortcuts for Efficiency

CheckListr offers a wide range of keyboard shortcuts for common actions like adding, moving, indenting, and formatting items. Learning just a few can significantly speed up your workflow.

The most important keys to remember are **Insert** and **F2**:

- **Insert** adds a new item after the focused one.
- **Shift + Insert** adds a new item before the focused one.
- **Alt + Insert** adds a child item under the focused one.
- **F2** starts editing the item's title.

For a complete list, see the Keyboard Shortcuts section in the manual.


## Organize the List as a Tree

Use parent and child items to structure your checklist into a clear hierarchy. Indentation visually separates categories, tasks, and sub-tasks, making complex lists easier to manage.

To build your tree structure:

* Use **Alt + Insert** to add a child item.
* Use **Ctrl + Right** to increase indent (make child), 
  and **Ctrl + Left** to decrease indent (promote to parent level).
* Use **Ctrl + Up** and **Ctrl + Down** to move selected items up or down in the list.


## Use Checked State to Track Progress

CheckListr lets you mark items as completed using the checked state—great for tracking your progress through tasks.

* Press **Space** to toggle the checked state of the selected items.
* Press **F8** to hide or show checked items.


## Add Details with Descriptions

Each item in CheckListr supports an optional description to hold extra notes, instructions, or context.

* Press **Tab** to start editing the description of the selected item.

Use descriptions to clarify tasks, add reminders, or provide supporting information—without cluttering the main title.


## How to Select Multiple Items

Selecting multiple items lets you perform actions on several list entries at once 
— such as toggling their checked state, moving them together, deleting them, or changing formatting.

### Ways to Select Multiple Items

* **Ctrl + Click**: Hold Ctrl and click items to add or remove them from the current selection. Items do not need to be next to each other.
* **Shift + Click**: Select a continuous range by clicking the first item, then holding Shift and clicking the last.
* **Rubber Band Selection**: Click and drag in an empty area to draw a selection box around multiple items. Hold Ctrl while dragging to add to the existing selection.

Efficient selection makes list management faster and more flexible.
