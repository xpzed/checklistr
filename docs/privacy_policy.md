# CheckListr Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** July 30, 2025

Your privacy is important. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown of how we handle your data when you use CheckListr.

## What does CheckListr actually do?
CheckListr is a desktop app that connects to your Google Account so you can manage your Google Tasks right from your computer. It acts as a window to your tasks stored with Google.

## What information do you access?
To make the app work, we need your permission to access two things from Google:
1.  **Your Basic Profile Info:** Your name and email, just to confirm it's you and show it in the app.
2.  **Your Google Tasks Data:** This includes your task lists, the tasks themselves, notes, and due dates.

We need this access so we can display your tasks and save any changes you make.

## Where is my data stored?
This is important:
* Your actual **task data** is always stored on **Google's servers**, just like it is now.
* A secure **login token** is stored **on your own computer**. This lets the app log you in automatically without you needing to enter your password every time.

**We do not have our own servers that store any of your personal data.**

## Do you share my data with anyone?
**No. Absolutely not.** We will never sell, trade, or share your information with any third party. The only data movement is directly between the app on your computer and Google's servers.

## How do I delete my data or stop access?
You are in full control.
* **To delete tasks**, simply delete them in CheckListr or any other Google Tasks app. The data lives in your Google Account.
* **To revoke access**, go to your Google Account permissions page ([myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)), find CheckListr in the list, and remove its access. Uninstalling the app from your computer will also delete its stored login token.
